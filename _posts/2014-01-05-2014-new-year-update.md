So its been a great year for me as a student and part time web developer.
I was able to work in a great responsive web site  <a href="http://www.estatesales.net" target="_blank">EstateSales.NET</a> and learned much from it.
Now that its 2014 I will graduate in the spring and I have officially been hired as a full time
web developer at <a href="http://www.vintagesoftware.com" target="_blank">Vintage Software</a>. Excited to start new projects this year. This year I will be
focusing on some new topics.

- Web performance on responsive web sites.
- Maintainable responsive design
- Resilient web design
- Off-line support on web applications

Look for me on [Github](https://github.com/splintercode) & [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/splintercode) for any new projects or want to collaborate just 
tweet me [@splintercode](https://twitter.com/splintercode) Happy new year!
