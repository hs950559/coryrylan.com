I had the great opportunity to write a guest blog post on <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor" target="_blank">Cory House's</a> blog Outlier Developer. My post covers a few tips 
on improving technical reading skills. <a href="http://www.outlierdeveloper.com/improve-your-technical-reading-skills/" target="_blank">Improve Your Technical Reading Skills</a>.

        <p>Over the past few of years I have read a lot on programming and other technical topics.&nbsp;Some of the books have been very in depth with lots of detailed code examples. It’s easy to say you read a technical book&nbsp;on a given topic. It’s harder to say you understand and retained what you have read.</p>
        <p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.outlierdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/technical-reading.gif"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18813" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.outlierdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/technical-reading.gif?resize=340%2C208" alt="technical-reading" width="340" height="208"></a></p>
        <p>I found myself trying to read as many books as I could and not truly comprehending the topic I was reading.&nbsp;So over the past year or two I have found a couple of tips that have helped me slow down and become more productive&nbsp;when reading technical/programming books.</p>
        <h2>Tabs, lots of tabs.</h2>
        <p>No I’m not talking about browser tabs. When I read any technical book I use page tabs and mark pages that&nbsp;have content that resonates with me or I find to be very useful.</p>
        <p>I recently read the <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">“You don’t know JS”</a> book series by <a href="https://twitter.com/getify" target="_blank">Kyle Simpson</a>.&nbsp;These books are fantastically detailed and are great if you want to learn the intricacies of JavaScript.&nbsp;But that’s where I trip up. There is so much information and detail that it’s hard to remember it all. I use tabs of&nbsp;varying colors to mark pages that may have information I feel like is very important&nbsp;or is something that I am likely to come back to.</p>
        <p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.outlierdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reading-tabs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18812" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.outlierdeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/reading-tabs.jpg?resize=340%2C209" alt="reading-tabs" width="340" height="209"></a></p>
        <p>My color system is simple. Red tabs are warnings of things that could&nbsp;trip me up while programming (I’m looking at you JavaScript). Purple are conceptual ideas that I feel are really useful or valuable. Green and yellow I use interchangeably&nbsp;to mark helpful tips I don’t want to forget. I commonly find myself referencing these books over and over and the tabs really help make&nbsp;it easier to find the information I need.</p>
        <p>You can use any color system, this is just the one that has helped me. Any type of page&nbsp;tabs will work. I use something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Post--Assorted-Colors-Dispensers-683-VAD1/dp/B000MK4RAM/ref=sr_1_2" target="_blank">this</a>.&nbsp;Also it is important to have these things everywhere! I keep a set in my personal desk, work desk, and my backpack. I can&nbsp;always mark things down no matter what I am reading.</p>
        <h2>Read it twice.</h2>
        <p>Another great tip that has gone a long way is to read each chapter twice before moving on to the next chapter.&nbsp;I first heard about this when reading Dale Carnegie’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034" target="_blank">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</a>.&nbsp;This is great advice. This forced me to slow down and understand the concepts that I am reading. I can’t even think of how many times I&nbsp;have re-read a chapter and realized I missed a subtle detail or technical tidbit that was important. It may take me&nbsp;twice as long to read a book but I get far more information out of it.</p>
        <h2>Make it a habit.</h2>
        <p>Making reading a habit can be difficult. When it comes to technical books going long periods of time without reading can really&nbsp;trip up your learning. Only reading a few pages every few days or once a week makes it hard to remember&nbsp;what the topic or context was the last time you read it. It’s similar to not seeing code you wrote in over a week.</p>
        <p>Make it a habit to read every morning or night. Even if it’s for only 10 minutes. It’s a lot easier to remember what you read for 10 minutes&nbsp;last night than what you read for 30 minutes a week ago. This was one of my greatest struggles but I can assure you that&nbsp;it really does make a difference.</p>
        <h2>Use a bookshelf.</h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor" target="_blank">Cory House’s</a> Pluralsight course&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/career-reboot-for-developer-mind" target="_blank">Becoming an Outlier: Reprogramming the Developer Mind</a>&nbsp;he suggests having a bookshelf at work. Having a bookshelf with your programming books can&nbsp;help serve as a positive reminder of the topics you have learned. People can see topics you know or are interested in, which can&nbsp;help start conversations between developers. Making your skills more visible to other developers can&nbsp;make you more valuable to a team. This can also help identify what topics would be most valuable for you to read up on.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These are just a few of the things I have tried that have really helped me become better at reading programming and technical&nbsp;books over the past year. I’d love to hear other peoples ideas and advice on this topic in the comments!</p>
