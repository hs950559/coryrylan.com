Here are my notes from University of Illinois Web Con 2014. These are from the talk
"Learn Every Programming Language" by <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickDelancy" target="_blank">Patrick Delancy</a>

<strong>4 programming paradigms</strong>

1. Procedural
1. Logical
1. Functional
1. Object Oriented

<strong>Procedural</strong>

- Loops
- Procedures/Functions/Subroutines
- Global/Static Variables
- GoTo
- Lexical Scoping

<strong>Object Oriented</strong>

- Class/Entity</li>
- Abstraction (interfaces)</li>
- Encapsulation</li>
- Inheritance</li>
- Polymorphism</li>

<strong>Functional</strong>

- Focuses on the process and not the entity models
- Functions as values
- Pattern Matching
- Composition
- Partial Application
- Monad/Computation Expression
- Closures (JavaScript and C#)
- Deconstruction/Decomposition
- Currying (JavaScript)
- Recursion/Tail Recursion
- Option/Maybe
- cons/car/cdr

<strong>Logical</strong>

- Facts
- Relationships
- Very declarative
